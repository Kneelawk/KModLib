Changes:

* Added a constructor to `UnbakedCubeAllModelLayer` that takes an `Identifier` instead of a `JsonTexture`.
* Added the ability for connected-texture model layers to render on items.
* Added `cube`, `cube_bottom_top` and `cube_column` model layers.
* Added support for model layers choosing not to render sides.
